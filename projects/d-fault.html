                                dice and coins around in an efficient way to complete the holes. Every level has

                            being done in Unity's language, <strong>C#</strong>. The sites that we used to collaborate
                            on
                            the game development were <strong>Perforce</strong> and <strong>Github</strong>. When
                            formally
                            playtesting utilized our game, we stored our data in <strong>Google Sheets</strong> to
                            calculate
                            various statistics from our playtests. Our communication hub was <strong>Discord</strong>,
                            as we hosted weekly meetings and shared our ideas on it.</p>

                            was the level design and coding the mechanics, while Amari
                            King primarily focused on the visuals and art aesthetics and Minhao Wu helped with the
                            mechanic ideation as well as documentation. Furthermore, we collaborated with students from
                            the Berklee
                            College of Music for our sound design, and we received many excellent themes and sound
                            effects
                            from them.</p>
