                    <p class="fs-5">"D-Fault" is an isometric puzzle-solving game developed using Unity
                        and
                        C#.
                        Centered around
                        manipulating dice and coins, players must efficiently navigate through 25 handcrafted levels,
                        with
                        each
                        level having multiple
                        solutions to encourage creative problem-solving. The game unfolds as an off-screen protagonist
                        discovers
                        her game design
                        skills, with puzzles reflecting her evolving creativity through scattered notes and scribbles.
                        D-Fault is planning to release on Steam and itch.io in the near future, and visitors can also
                        download the game directly on this website.</p>

                        was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                        Utilizing Bootstrap for design and JQuery for transition animations, the website is
                        aesthetically pleasing and
                        interactive. The site details the languages, libraries, and tools used in its creation,
                        including Visual Studio Code and
                        Figma. The responsiveness of the website is highlighted, adapting seamlessly to different screen
                        sizes for an optimal
                        user experience. Visitors can explore the site's development journey and view snapshots of its

                        provides users with the ability to explore
                        past and current prices of various stocks. The application allows users to search for stocks by

                        USC students find and connect with study groups. Users can search for study groups based on

                        Pages for hosting. Real-time chat
                        functionality was achieved through Node.js and Pusher's API, with Nodemailer handling email
                        notifications for study
                        sessions.</p>
