                    <p class="fs-5">I created a robust task management system leveraging React and React Router to enable efficient task creation, viewing,
                    and sorting. The application allows users to customize tasks with attributes like priority, due date, status, and tags,
                    offering advanced functionality such as task pinning, dynamic filtering, and multi-criteria sorting (by due date, title,
                    and priority). Users can seamlessly add, edit, and delete tasks, with features like automatic tag suggestions and the
                    ability to manage task statuses. The system integrates with a RESTful API for task CRUD operations and utilizes a
                    relational database structure to optimize data management. This project highlights my skills in full-stack development,
                    front-end frameworks, API integration, and efficient data handling.</p>
